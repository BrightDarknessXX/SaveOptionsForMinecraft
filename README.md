# SaveOptionsForMinecraft
This script makes profiles for your options in minecraft. If you change versions, you can restore your options and settings if they're set to default.
So you don't have to manually set everything to your settings you're used to.
The "profiles" are stored in .minecraft, where you also have to store the bat file. It basically copies the options and renames it for you.

It saves these options:
options.txt
optionsof.txt
hotbar.nbt
optionsshaders.txt
config\
